# FlightRecorder Receiver

The FlightRecorder receiver collects profiles, generated by Go's [trace.FlightRecorder](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/trace#FlightRecorder), from files specified with a global pattern.


## Configuration
- `include` (required): The glob path for files to watch
- `collection_interval` (default = `1m`): The interval at which metrics are emitted by this receiver.
- `initial_delay` (default = `1s`): defines how long this receiver waits before starting.

### Example

```yaml
receivers:
  flightrecorder:
    include: /tmp/flightrecorder/*
    collection_interval: 10s
    initial_delay: 1s

service:
  pipelines:
    profiles:
      receivers: [flightrecorder]
      exporters: [otlp/profiles]

    metrics:
      receivers: [flightrecorder]
      exporters: [otlp/metrics]
```

### Note

This receiver does not replace specialized tools like [gotraceui](https://gotraceui.dev/), as the transformation from the format of [trace.FlightRecorder](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/trace#FlightRecorder) to [OpenTelemetry Profiles](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/profiles/) is **NOT** lossless.
